# opcraft-mud2

This is a port of OPCraft to MUD2.

Note: Not everything is ported over, in particular:
- tutorial components
- plugins
- optimistic updates
- staking / claiming land
- background music (turned off intentionally)
- creative mode
- crafting
- The block explorer (shows you how many blocks you placed/mined in every block transaction on the chain)
- The component browser (the sidebar that appears when you press ~. mud2 has a much nicer “component browser”)
