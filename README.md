# OPCraft w/ MUD v2

This is a port of [OPCraft](https://github.com/latticexyz/opcraft) to MUD V2.

**Note:** Not everything is ported over, in particular:
- plugins
- staking / claiming land
- crafting, recipes
- creative mode
- the component browser (the sidebar that appears when you press `~` in MUD V2 has a much nicer "component browser")

### Running locally

1. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies
2. Run `pnpmm run dev`
